Software projects are rarely solo missions. Most of the time, you’re working with a team — whether that’s two people hacking on a side project or hundreds of engineers pushing updates to a product used worldwide. But working in teams introduces its own complexities, and one of the best explanations of this comes from a classic book: *The Mythical Man-Month* by Fred Brooks.

First published in 1975, the book is still eerily relevant today. Brooks’ main idea is simple but powerful: **adding more people to a late project often makes it later**. That’s the mythical “man-month” — the false assumption that one month of work by one person equals the same as one month of work by ten people.

Spoiler: it doesn’t.

## The Communication Tax

One of the key insights Brooks shared is that communication overhead grows as the team grows. With two people, communication is simple. With five, it gets trickier. With twenty, suddenly half your time is spent in meetings, syncs, and endless Slack threads.

The formula is roughly:
**Number of communication channels = n(n-1)/2**

So if you have a 5-person team, there are 10 possible channels. With 10 people, there are 45. With 50 people, 1,225. That’s a lot of talking instead of coding.

This doesn’t mean big teams are doomed — it just means they need structure. Clear roles, good documentation, and strong leadership help reduce unnecessary noise.

## The Illusion of Parallelism

Imagine you’re building a car. You can have one person install the tires and another paint the doors at the same time. That’s parallel work. But in software, tasks often aren’t that independent.

If you add three new developers to a project, they can’t just magically code in parallel. They first need onboarding, context, and alignment with the existing system. And guess who provides that? The original team members — who now spend more time teaching and less time building.

So while it looks like you’re adding more “hands on deck,” what you’re really doing is slowing things down in the short term.

## The Role of Small, Focused Teams

One lesson I’ve taken from Brooks is that small, focused teams often achieve more than large, sprawling ones. A small team can move quickly, make decisions faster, and keep communication lightweight.

That doesn’t mean big teams are useless — many products require scale. But when possible, breaking large teams into smaller, semi-independent groups with clear ownership can help maintain momentum.

This is why concepts like Amazon’s “two-pizza team” exist — the idea that a team should be small enough to be fed with two pizzas. It’s not about pizza, obviously; it’s about keeping teams nimble.

## The Human Factor

Another insight from *The Mythical Man-Month* is that software isn’t built by interchangeable “resources” — it’s built by people. Each person brings unique strengths, weaknesses, and quirks.

Throwing more people into a project without considering how they’ll collaborate, complement each other, and share knowledge is a recipe for friction. Successful teams aren’t just technically skilled; they’re socially cohesive. Trust, respect, and clear communication are as important as code quality.

## Why It Still Matters Today

It’s been decades since Brooks wrote his book, but the lessons still apply. Agile, DevOps, and modern tooling have changed how we work, but they haven’t erased the realities of coordination, communication, and human limitations.

Whenever I see a struggling project, I often hear someone suggest: “We just need to add more engineers.” And every time, I think of Brooks, shaking his head from 1975.

### Closing Thoughts

Working in a team is both the biggest strength and the biggest challenge of software engineering. The Mythical Man-Month reminds us that more people doesn’t automatically mean more progress. Sometimes the best move isn’t to scale up, but to focus, clarify, and simplify.

At the end of the day, software is built by people, not man-months. And understanding that is the first step to building better teams — and better products.
