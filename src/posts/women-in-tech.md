## Speaking Two Languages

Sometimes I feel like I’m speaking two languages at once. One is the technical
language of code, servers, and systems. The other is the unspoken language of
navigating a workplace where being a woman often comes with invisible barriers.
I’ve been lucky to work with supportive colleagues, but I’ve also had moments
where I felt like I had to prove my worth twice over, like explaining a design
choice not once, but multiple times, to make sure it’s “taken seriously.”

## Early Career Lessons

Early in my career, I remember presenting a new feature I built, a dashboard that
pulled together complex system metrics. I was genuinely excited, but during the
demo, a colleague suggested I “simplify it” before showing it to management.
The suggestion was practical, but the subtext felt like: your work is too detailed,
too ambitious. I learned that sometimes I need to adapt how I present ideas
without losing their depth or value. That lesson has stayed with me ever since.

## Speaking Up and Being Heard

There have been meetings where I’ve shared a suggestion, only to have someone
else repeat the exact same idea a few minutes later, and receive the praise.
At first, it stung. But it also taught me the importance of persistence, clear
communication, and following up when necessary. I’ve started keeping small notes
during meetings, reminding myself to speak confidently and back up ideas with
examples. It’s a subtle strategy, but it’s helped me make sure my voice is heard.

## Side Projects and Visibility

Side projects have been another lens into how gender dynamics can play out. I once
built a tool for visualizing server health that I hoped would become a team resource.
Initially, my contributions were treated as experimental or “fun,” whereas when
a male colleague contributed a similar feature, it was framed as essential and
high-impact. These experiences reinforced the importance of documenting my work,
sharing progress, and advocating for my projects, even when they feel small. Sometimes,
the difference between being seen and being overlooked is simply in how you present
your work.

## Common Biases in Tech

Many biases women face in IT are subtle but pervasive. Assumptions that women are
less technical, expectations to be more “agreeable,” or having to explain work
more often than male peers are all too common. Even performance evaluations and
promotions can be influenced by unconscious biases, making visibility and advocacy
crucial. Recognizing these patterns is the first step, but actively supporting
one another and calling out inequities, even gently, is how change begins.

## Continuing to Build

Despite the challenges, I love building. I mentor juniors, work on side projects,
and create things that make my work enjoyable. Each small success, whether a
dashboard, a script, or a playful side project, feels like a tiny victory.
I also speak up when I see inequities, whether in meetings or informal
conversations. Small steps, repeated over time, can slowly change the culture.

## Closing Note

Being a woman in tech isn’t always easy, but it has shaped me as a developer
and as a person. I’ve learned to trust my ideas, stand my ground, and keep
building, even when the path isn’t perfectly level. If you’re a woman navigating
similar challenges, know you’re not alone.

Reach out, share your experiences, or just connect with someone who understands.
Sometimes, a conversation, a piece of advice, or simply feeling heard is the
first step toward feeling supported.
