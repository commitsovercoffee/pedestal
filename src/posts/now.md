*This is what I’m up to right now (Last updated: September 2025)*

## What I’m Working On
- Tinkering with some silly side projects.
- Writing more regularly on my blog.
- Slowly learning more about design and UX.

---

## What I’m Learning
- Picking up bits of Rust, mostly out of curiosity.
- Reading *The Design of Everyday Things* (finally).

---

## What I’m Thinking About

How online spaces shape what we create (and what we don’t).

---

## Outside of Work
- Trying to walk more instead of scrolling more.
- Sketching badly but enjoying it anyway.
- Hunting for good coffee spots.

That’s me right now.
