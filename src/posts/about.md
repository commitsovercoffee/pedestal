## Who I Am (Roughly)

I write code for a living or at least, that's the part people can put on a résumé. Most days,
I’m somewhere between a developer, a digital tinkerer, and a mildly caffeinated problem-solver.
I enjoy making things that (hopefully) work, breaking things that probably shouldn’t, and
occasionally cleaning up the mess in between.

## What I Do (More or Less)

Professionally, I write code. Sometimes it works on the first try, but usually, it works after a
healthy amount of trial, error, and Googling something I absolutely should’ve remembered. I’ve
touched front-end, back-end, and all the strange glue in between. Side projects happen. Some
finish. Most don’t. That’s okay.

Outside of that, I tend to bounce between hobbies like I’m speedrunning a midlife crisis.
I lose games of Dota with alarming consistency, pretend to read books I swear I’ll finish,
and occasionally try to “get into” new things like chess, cooking, or whatever YouTube
recommends at 1:30 a.m.

Somewhere between work, hobbies, and existential scrolling, I manage to ship projects, or at
least get them far enough to break, learn from, and rebuild better. That’s the cycle, really:
build, break, repeat (plus snacks).

## Why I Build Things

I like the feeling of taking something abstract and making it real. Whether it’s a tool, a toy,
or a strange website, there’s something fun about turning thought into
interface. It doesn’t have to be revolutionary. It just has to be something that didn’t exist
before. I like conversations that start with “what if we tried…” and end in a Git repo.

## The Rest of It

When I’m away from screens, you might find me wandering trails, pretending to be good at frisbee,
or just sitting outside wondering how the clouds got there. I’m usually trying to learn
something new, unlearn something old, or remember where I left my phone.

## That's Me

If you're looking for a tidy origin story, I probably don’t have one. Just a string of moments,
half-finished ideas, and code that sometimes compiles. But if you’re here, reading this,
welcome. I’m glad you stopped by.
