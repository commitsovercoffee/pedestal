Spend five minutes scrolling through LinkedIn, Twitter, or YouTube, and you’ll probably run into them: the *pseudo tech influencers*. They’re the ones with “ex-FAANG” plastered all over their bios, big promises about getting you your dream job, and a shiny course link in every other post.

On paper, their story looks impressive: *worked at Google, now teaching you how to land a six-figure role*. But when you dig a little deeper, the reality is often less glamorous. Many of these folks spent only a short time in tech, maybe a year or two, sometimes just an internship, before pivoting to selling advice full-time.

## Selling Titles, Not Experience

The common thread with pseudo tech influencers is that they lean heavily on the *title*, not the depth of their experience. “Ex-FAANG” sounds powerful, but it tells you nothing about what they actually did there, how long they worked, or what kind of impact they had.

This isn’t to discredit anyone who’s had a stint at a big-name company, even getting in is an achievement. But turning a short-lived role into a lifelong credential, and then selling it as a guarantee of expertise, feels misleading. It’s like someone doing one semester of med school and then opening a “How to Be a Doctor” bootcamp.

## The Course Hustle

Courses are where the pseudo influencer playbook really shines. They package generic advice into shiny slides, slap on a few “insider secrets,” and price it at hundreds of dollars.

Often, the content isn’t even wrong, it’s just obvious. “Practice LeetCode.” “Study system design.” “Network with recruiters.” Stuff you can find for free with a quick Google search. The difference is that it’s wrapped in a personal brand that says: *trust me, I’ve been there*.

What makes it tricky is that for newcomers, it can feel legit. If you’re new to tech, it’s easy to assume that someone with “ex-Facebook” in their bio has some magical key to success. And in that gap between perception and reality, the influencer thrives.

## The Problem Isn’t Ambition

To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with teaching, mentoring, or even selling courses. Plenty of people build great, ethical businesses around helping others break into tech. The problem is when the marketing outpaces the actual experience, when the illusion of expertise becomes more important than the expertise itself.

It cheapens the real stories of people who spent years grinding, learning, and actually building things. It also sets unrealistic expectations for those buying in. Students end up thinking: *if I just follow these steps, I’ll get hired too*. But careers aren’t cookie-cutter, and real mentorship requires more than recycled platitudes.

## Why People Fall for It

The reason pseudo tech influencers succeed isn’t just their branding, it’s our collective obsession with shortcuts. Breaking into tech is hard. It’s natural to want a step-by-step guide, especially one from someone who seems to have “made it.”

We’re drawn to authority signals like big company names, and influencers know it. That “ex-FAANG” tag is social proof in four letters, and it works.

## A Better Way Forward

Instead of chasing pseudo gurus, the better bet is to look for people who:

- **Share their work** : People who make their process visible through open-source projects, detailed breakdowns, or case studies. You get to see not just the finished product, but how they think, make decisions, and solve problems along the way.
- **Admit their limits** : Those who are honest about what they don’t know, the areas they haven’t mastered, or where their experience ends. It’s refreshing to learn from someone who acknowledges uncertainty instead of pretending to have all the answers.
- **Teach rather than sell** : Creators who focus on giving useful content for free and offer optional paid material to go deeper. They’re not hiding obvious advice behind a paywall or trying to monetize every tip—they genuinely want to help you learn.
- **Stay active in the field** : Instructors who keep working in tech while teaching, instead of jumping into the influencer path the moment it looks easier. Their guidance is grounded in real, current experience, not just theory or past success.

## Conclusion

Pseudo tech influencers are a symptom of our hustle-obsessed, brand-driven era. They’re not the biggest problem in tech, but they do reveal how easily titles can overshadow substance.

If you’re learning to code or trying to break into the industry, remember: you don’t need someone else’s shiny badge to validate your path. What matters is what you build, how you grow, and the skills you take with you, not whether your mentor once had a desk at Google for six months.
