	<p class="italic">A few things about me, give or take a few updates.</p>

	<h2>Who I Am (Roughly)</h2>
	<p>
		I write code for a living—or at least, that's the part people can put on a résumé. Most days,
		I’m somewhere between a developer, a digital tinkerer, and a mildly caffeinated problem-solver.
		I enjoy making things that (hopefully) work, breaking things that probably shouldn’t, and
		occasionally cleaning up the mess in between.
	</p>
	<h2>What I Do (More or Less)</h2>
	<p>
		Professionally, I write code. Sometimes it works on the first try, but usually, it works after a
		healthy amount of trial, error, and Googling something I absolutely should’ve remembered. I’ve
		touched front-end, back-end, and all the strange glue in between. Side projects happen. Some
		finish. Most don’t. That’s okay.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of that, I tend to bounce between hobbies like I’m speedrunning a midlife crisis in slow
		motion. I lose games of Dota with alarming consistency, pretend to read books I swear I’ll
		finish, and occasionally try to “get into” new things like chess, cooking, or whatever YouTube
		recommends at 1:30 a.m.
	</p>
	<p>
		Somewhere between work, hobbies, and existential scrolling, I manage to ship projects — or at
		least get them far enough to break, learn from, and rebuild better. That’s the cycle, really:
		build, break, repeat (plus snacks).
	</p>
	<h2>Why I Build Things (In Theory)</h2>
	<p>
		I like the feeling of taking something abstract and making it real. Whether it’s a tool, a toy,
		or a weird little corner of the internet, there’s something fun about turning thought into
		interface. It doesn’t have to be revolutionary. It just has to be something that didn’t exist
		before.
	</p>
	<h2>The Rest of It</h2>
	<p>
		Outside the keyboard, I’m usually trying to learn something new, unlearn something old, or
		remember where I left my phone. I like long walks through documentation, open tabs I’ll never
		revisit, and conversations that start with “what if we tried…” and end in a Git repo.
	</p>
	<h2>That's Me (For Now)</h2>
	<p>
		If you're looking for a tidy origin story, I probably don’t have one. Just a string of moments,
		half-finished ideas, and code that sometimes compiles. But if you’re here, reading this —
		welcome. I’m glad you stopped by.
